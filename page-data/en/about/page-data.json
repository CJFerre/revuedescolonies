Little known today beyond a few reedited selections, the journal remains a fundamental source of insight into the complex relationships between colonial, national, and racial identities; the role of the periodical press as a vector for political and social change; and the formation of intellectual and political solidarities on a global scale over the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>\n<h2 style=\"clear: both\">Project Goals</h2>\n<p>The purpose of this project is to preserve the legacy of this remarkable and influential journal by making it accessible to researchers, students, and interested members of the general public.

This edition has been encoded according to the P5 Guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). Each issue and corresponding translation is transcribed into a TEI file.

Many of the editorial choices within the edition are motivated by considerations of accessibility. Spellings, for instance, appear modernized by default, though a version of the text featuring original spellings (which correspond to conventions predating widespread 1835 orthographic reforms) is available via the edition’s interface. Each page can easily be switched between original French, modernized French, or English translation, with notes, including bibliographic references, available in either language. Images of the original issues can be accessed by clicking on the minimized bar marking the page change.</p>\n<h2>Translation and critical apparatus</h2>\n<p>In translating the <em>Revue</em> into English, we have tried to preserve, to the highest degree possible, the positionality and often subtle political inflections of its language, as well as the original turns or phrase and syntactic structures, using contemporaneous English-language publications as models.</p>\n<p>Notes fall into two overarching categories: reference notes corresponding to “named entities” in the site’s index, which appear at each first mention of a given individual, location, publication, or institution, and commentary notes, which offer context for specific passages or explain particular terms or allusions.
